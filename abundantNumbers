# An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors (divisors not including the number itself) is greater than the number itself. For example 12 is abundant because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 which add up to 16.
# Print all the abundant numbers from 1 to 200 inclusive, each on their own line.

[print(n) for n in range(1,201) if sum([i for i in range(1,n) if n%i==0])>n]
